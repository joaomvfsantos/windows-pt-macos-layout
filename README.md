# Windows PT-PT Layout for Apple Magic Keyboards

A Windows keyboard layout that matches Portuguese Apple Magic Keyboards.

This is the source file meant to be used and compiled with the [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22339).

This was only tested with the Apple Magic Keyboard (1st generation) with PT layout as it's the one I own. I haven't mapped all keys so far, so there might be some which are still not correct.
